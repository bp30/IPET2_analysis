BACKGROUND: 
IPET2 is a follow-up experiment to IPET that aim to assess whether the prosocial simulation effect (PSE) (i.e., imagine helping a person will lead to an increase in willingness to help him/her) can be extended to trusting the person they imagined. The following research questions were assess:

1. Replicate the PSE in willingness to help and trust.
2. Assess whether vividness of the simulated events plays a modulating role in PSE in willingness to help and trust.
3. Examine whether Perspective taking mediate the PSE effect in willingness to help.
4. Examine whether willingness to help mediate the PSE effect in trust.
5. Assess whether individual difference in personal belief in the norm of reciprocity will modulate the PSE in trust.
6. Bayesian cumulative mixed model replication of questions 1, 2 and 5.
